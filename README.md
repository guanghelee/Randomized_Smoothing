## Package version 

 * Please see each directory

## Release Schedule

 * This is an initial release for computing \rho^{-1}(0.5) in the MNIST experiment by an email request. The rest of the experiments will be released gradually. If you need some help on some other experiments, please let me know (guanghe@mit.edu) and I will try to see whether I can release it soon.
