This repository is for the paper

 * "[A Stratified Approach to Robustness for Randomly Smoothed Classifiers](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1906.04948.pdf)" by [Guang-He Lee](https://people.csail.mit.edu/guanghe/), [Yang Yuan](http://www.callowbird.com), [Shiyu Chang](http://people.csail.mit.edu/chang87/), and [Tommi S. Jaakkola](http://people.csail.mit.edu/tommi/) in NeurIPS 2019.

## Experiments 

 * Please see each experiment in the corresponding directory (and the README therein).

## Release Schedule

 * The MNIST experiment has been released. 
 * The pre-computed &rho;<sup>-1</sup><sub>r</sub>(0.5) and trained ResNet50 models have been released for the ImageNet experiment.
 * I will try to release other experiments gradually... If you need some help on other experiments, please let me know (guanghe@mit.edu), and I will try to release it soon.
