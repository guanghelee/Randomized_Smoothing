# Tight Certificates of Adversarial Robustness for Randomly Smoothed Classifiers:

This repository is for the paper

 * "[Tight Certificates of Adversarial Robustness for Randomly Smoothed Classifiers](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1906.04948.pdf)" by [Guang-He Lee](https://people.csail.mit.edu/guanghe/), [Yang Yuan](http://www.callowbird.com), [Shiyu Chang](http://people.csail.mit.edu/chang87/), and [Tommi S. Jaakkola](http://people.csail.mit.edu/tommi/) in NeurIPS 2019.
 * The old title for this paper is "A Stratified Approach to Robustness for Randomly Smoothed Classifiers"

## Outline
 
 * Please see each experiment in the corresponding directory (and the README therein).
 * The MNIST experiment has been released. 
 * The ImageNet experiment has been released. (Not carefully checked. Please let me know if you find any problem.)
 * The pre-computed &rho;<sup>-1</sup><sub>r</sub>(0.5) and trained ResNet50 models have been released for the ImageNet experiment.
 * If you want to compute your own &rho;<sup>-1</sup><sub>r</sub>(0.5), please see the examples in the MNIST or ImageNet folder.
 * Please let me know ((guanghe@mit.edu)) if you need the codes for the decision tree experiment.
