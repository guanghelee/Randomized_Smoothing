# MNIST experiment:

This repository is for the paper

 * "[A Stratified Approach to Robustness for Randomly Smoothed Classifiers](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1906.04948.pdf)" by [Guang-He Lee](https://people.csail.mit.edu/guanghe/), [Yang Yuan](http://www.callowbird.com), [Shiyu Chang](http://people.csail.mit.edu/chang87/), and [Tommi S. Jaakkola](http://people.csail.mit.edu/tommi/) in NeurIPS 2019.

## Outline 

### Package version 

 * PyTorch0.4.1
 * python3.6.1

### Release schedule

 * Pre-computed &rho;<sup>-1</sup><sub>r</sub>(0.5) are available in [main/thresholds/imagenet/](main/thresholds/imagenet/)
 * Trained ResNet50 models are availabble in [Google drive](https://drive.google.com/file/d/19p6uN4-37HzF1dD8whXAkjuLcCzMDKOM/view?usp=sharing), which should be compatible with the codes (with the official PyTorch ResNet50) in the MNIST directory. 
 * The training and testing codes will be released soon...
